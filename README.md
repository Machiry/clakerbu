Tool to get cumulative LLVM bitcode files for kernel.

This tool helps you get cumulative bitcode files for kernel files. This is helpful for any instrumentation tasks based on `LLVM`. For instance, You can use this tool to build the bitcode file for a driver, perform instrumentation, convert it back to object file, and then use the `make` to create the kernel with the instrumented driver.

## Note
For the kernels built using `gcc` this tool only works for `arm32` or `aarch64` architectures.

## Dependencies
* Install [Bear](https://github.com/Machiry/Bear)
* Install [clang and llvm](http://releases.llvm.org/) 

## How to use:
### Build your kernel.
Run `make` using the following command:
```
bear make
```
The above command will create `compile_commands.json` in the current directory.

### Running
```
usage: clakerbu.py [-h] -l LLVM_BC_OUT -k KERNEL_SRC_DIR -m COMPILE_JSON -n
                   ARCH_NUM [-isclang] [-clangp CLANG_PATH]
                   [-llvmlinkp LLVMLINK_PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LLVM_BC_OUT        Destination directory where all the generated bitcode
                        files should be stored.
  -k KERNEL_SRC_DIR     Base directory of the kernel sources.
  -m COMPILE_JSON       Path to the json file generated by Bear.
  -isclang              flag to indicate that clang was used to built the
                        kernel
  -clangp CLANG_PATH    Absolute path to the clang binary (if not provided,
                        the one available in the path will be used)
  -llvmlinkp LLVMLINK_PATH
                        Absolute path to the llvm-link binary (if not
                        provided, the one available in the path will be used)

```
Example (if built using `gcc`):
```
cd clakerbu/
python clakerbu.py -l /llvm_bitcode_out -k <PATH_WHERE_YOU_RAN_MAKE> -m <PATH_TO_THE_COMPILE_COMMANDS_JSON_CREATED_ABOVE>
```

If your kernel was originally built with `clang+llvm`, then you should specify the flag `-isclang`, path to the `clang` that was used to build the kernel (this is usually what you would have provided for `REAL_CC`) and path to the `llvm-link`.

Example (if built using `clang`):
```
cd clakerbu/
python clakerbu.py -l /llvm_bitcode_out -k <PATH_WHERE_YOU_RAN_MAKE> -m <PATH_TO_THE_COMPILE_COMMANDS_JSON_CREATED_ABOVE> -isclang -clangp <PATH_TO_CLANG_THAT_WAS_USED_TO_BUILT_THE_KERNEL> -llvmlinkp <PATH_TO_THE_LLVM_LINK (usually in the same folder as the clang)>
```

The driver bitcode files will be present in the folder `<LLVM_BC_OUT>` with extension `final.linked.bc` along with other intermediate files.

The kernel modules end with `..final.linked.bc` i.e., if you find `iproc-rng200..final.linked.bc`, that means it is the bitcode file for `iproc-rng200.ko` from the kernel build.
